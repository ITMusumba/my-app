# Day 67 — Production Activation (Controlled, Minimal, Audited)

## Purpose
Day 67 records whether production activation occurred or was explicitly blocked.

This is the **first day where activation is legally permitted**, but only if:
- Day 66 verification is complete
- Human readiness confirmations exist
- Authorization is valid

Day 67 does NOT assume activation occurred.

---

## Preconditions (Must Be Verified)

| Requirement | Source | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Day 66 verification complete | day66_pre_activation.md | ⬜ Not Verified |
| Human readiness confirmed | Day 66 | ⬜ Not Verified |
| Authorization valid | Day 64 | ⬜ Not Verified |
| Monitoring & rollback ready | Ops confirmation | ⬜ Not Verified |

If **any** item is not verified, activation is **BLOCKED**.

---

## Activation Decision

Select exactly one:

- ⬜ **Activated**
- ⬜ **Blocked — Preconditions Not Met**

---

## Activation Details (Only if Activated)

- Activation timestamp:
- Environment:
- URL:
- Scope of traffic enabled:
- Kill-switch available: Yes / No

---

## Evidence (Real Only)

If Activated, capture:
- Deployment confirmation
- Monitoring snapshot
- Initial health metrics

If NOT Activated:
> **No Evidence — Activation Not Performed**

---

## System Posture Statement

Select one:

- ⬜ Production is active under controlled conditions
- ⬜ Production is NOT active (activation blocked)

---

## Explicit Statements

- No fake evidence was created
- No activation occurred unless explicitly recorded
- Rollback authority remains intact

---

## Handoff

If Activated → Day 68 monitoring may apply  
If Blocked → Remain in pre-activation state
