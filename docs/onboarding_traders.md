## What This System Allows You to Do

### 1. Deposit Capital

**You can deposit money** into your platform wallet. This money is used to purchase produce from farmers.

**Example**:
- You deposit UGX 200,000 into your wallet
- This money is available for purchasing produce
- You can deposit more money anytime
- Your wallet balance is always visible

**Important**: This is a **closed-loop wallet** - money stays within the platform. You cannot withdraw to a bank account. Money moves between:
- Your wallet → Farmer payments → Inventory → Buyer sales → Your wallet

### 2. Purchase Produce from Farmers

**You can lock units** (10kg each) from farmer listings by paying upfront.

**Example**:
- Farmer lists 50kg of maize at UGX 2,000/kg
- You see 5 units of 10kg each
- You pay UGX 20,000 to lock 1 unit (10kg × UGX 2,000)
- Money is deducted from your wallet immediately
- You must wait for farmer to deliver within 6 hours

**How It Works**:
1. You browse available listings
2. You see produce type, price, and quantity
3. You pay to lock a unit (pay-to-lock)
4. Money is deducted from your wallet
5. Farmer must deliver within 6 hours
6. Admin verifies delivery
7. Produce becomes your inventory

### 3. View Your Capital and Profit

**You can see**:
- **Capital ledger**: Money you deposited
- **Profit ledger**: Money you earned from sales
- **Current balance**: Available money in your wallet
- **Locked capital**: Money locked in pending transactions
- **Total exposure**: Capital + locked orders + inventory value

**Example**:
- Capital deposited: UGX 500,000
- Profit earned: UGX 50,000
- Locked capital: UGX 100,000 (pending deliveries)
- Available balance: UGX 450,000
- Total exposure: UGX 600,000

### 4. Track Your Exposure

**You can see**:
- Your current exposure (how much money is at risk)
- Your exposure limit (UGX 1,000,000 maximum)
- How close you are to the limit
- What counts toward your exposure

**What Counts Toward Exposure**:
- Locked capital (money locked in pending transactions)
- Locked orders value (value of units you've paid for but not received)
- Inventory value (value of produce in storage)

### 5. View Your Inventory

**You can see**:
- Inventory in storage (produce you've received)
- Projected storage loss (kilo loss from storage fees)
- How long inventory has been in storage
- When storage fees will apply

**Storage Fees**:
- 0.5 kilos per day per 100kg block
- Example: 200kg inventory = 2 blocks × 0.5 kg/day = 1 kg/day lost
- Fees accumulate over time
- Sell inventory quickly to avoid fees

### 6. Aggregate Produce into Blocks

**You can aggregate** produce into 100kg blocks for buyers.

**Example**:
- You receive 10 units of 10kg each (100kg total)
- You aggregate into 1 block of 100kg
- Buyers can purchase 100kg blocks
- You sell to buyers when purchase window is open

## Strict Deadlines - This is Critical!

### ⚠️ 6-Hour Delivery Deadline (Farmer Must Deliver)

**When you pay for produce, the farmer has exactly 6 hours to deliver it.**

**Example Timeline**:
- **2:00 PM**: You pay UGX 20,000 for 10kg of maize
- **8:00 PM**: Farmer's delivery deadline
- **Farmer must deliver by 8:00 PM** or transaction may be reversed

**What Happens if Farmer is Late?**:
1. Admin reviews the delivery
2. Admin marks it as "late"
3. Admin may reverse the transaction:
   - You get your money back
   - Produce is unlocked (available for other traders)
   - You lose the purchase

**Your Protection**:
- ✅ Money is locked until delivery is verified
- ✅ Admin verifies all deliveries
- ✅ You get money back if delivery fails
- ✅ You're protected from late deliveries

**Important**: You cannot speed up the delivery deadline. It's fixed at 6 hours after payment.

### ⚠️ 48-Hour Buyer Pickup Deadline

**When a buyer purchases your inventory, they have exactly 48 hours to pick it up.**

**Example Timeline**:
- **Monday 2:00 PM**: Buyer purchases 100kg of maize
- **Wednesday 2:00 PM**: Buyer's pickup deadline
- **Buyer must pick up by Wednesday 2:00 PM** or purchase may be cancelled

**What Happens if Buyer is Late?**:
1. Admin reviews the pickup
2. Admin may cancel the purchase
3. Inventory becomes available again
4. You can sell to another buyer

**Your Protection**:
- ✅ Inventory is locked until pickup
- ✅ Admin monitors pickup deadlines
- ✅ You're protected from late pickups

### ⚠️ Storage Fee Deadline

**If inventory sits in storage, you lose kilos over time.**

**Storage Fee**: 0.5 kilos per day per 100kg block

**Example**:
- You have 200kg of maize in storage
- After 1 day: You lose 1 kg (200kg = 2 blocks × 0.5 kg/day)
- After 5 days: You lose 5 kg
- After 10 days: You lose 10 kg

**How to Avoid Storage Fees**:
- ✅ Sell inventory quickly
- ✅ Monitor your inventory
- ✅ Don't hoard inventory
- ✅ Move inventory fast

**Important**: Storage fees are automatic and cannot be avoided. Sell quickly to minimize loss.

## Spend Cap - Your Maximum Exposure

### ⚠️ UGX 1,000,000 Maximum Exposure

**You cannot have more than UGX 1,000,000 total exposure at any time.**

**What Counts Toward Exposure**:
- **Locked capital**: Money locked in pending transactions
- **Locked orders value**: Value of units you've paid for but not received
- **Inventory value**: Value of produce in storage

**Example**:
- Locked capital: UGX 300,000 (pending deliveries)
- Inventory value: UGX 700,000 (in storage)
- **Total exposure: UGX 1,000,000** (at the limit)

**What Happens if You Reach the Cap?**:
- ❌ You cannot lock more units
- ❌ You must wait for deliveries or sales
- ❌ System blocks new purchases
- ❌ You get a clear error message

**How to Stay Under the Cap**:
- ✅ Monitor your exposure regularly
- ✅ Sell inventory quickly
- ✅ Wait for deliveries to complete
- ✅ Don't lock too many units at once

**Important**: The cap is **strict and cannot be bypassed**. Plan your purchases carefully.

## Admin Authority - How It Works

### Admin Makes Final Decisions

**Admins are the final decision-makers** in Farm2Market Uganda. They:

1. **Verify Deliveries**
   - Admin checks if farmer delivered on time
   - Admin confirms produce quality
   - Admin marks delivery as "delivered" or "late"
   - Admin decides if transaction should be reversed

2. **Handle Disputes**
   - If there's a problem, admin investigates
   - Admin makes the final decision
   - Admin's decision is final - no appeals

3. **Reverse Transactions**
   - If farmer doesn't deliver, admin reverses transaction
   - You get your money back
   - Produce becomes available again

4. **Control Purchase Windows**
   - Admin opens/closes purchase windows for buyers
   - You can only sell when window is open
   - Admin controls market timing

5. **Monitor the System**
   - Admin watches all transactions
   - Admin ensures fairness
   - Admin protects all users

**Why Admin Authority?**
- Ensures fairness for everyone
- Prevents disputes from dragging on
- Protects you from bad farmers
- Keeps the system running smoothly

**What This Means for You**:
- Trust admin decisions
- Be patient with delivery verification
- Communicate with admin if you have problems
- Admin decisions are final - respect them

## Discouraging Side Trading - Why It Matters

### ❌ What is Side Trading?

**Side trading** means:
- Buying produce outside the platform
- Making deals with farmers directly (not through the platform)
- Bypassing the platform's payment system
- Avoiding platform rules and deadlines

### ✅ Why You Should NOT Do Side Trading

**1. You Lose Protection**
- Platform protects you with payment guarantees
- Platform tracks all transactions
- Platform ensures fair prices
- Side trading has no protection

**2. You Risk Your Money**
- Platform guarantees money back if delivery fails
- Platform ensures delivery verification
- Side trading has no guarantees
- You may lose money if farmer doesn't deliver

**3. You Miss Out on Opportunities**
- Platform connects you with multiple farmers
- More farmers = more purchase opportunities
- Side trading limits your reach
- You may miss better deals

**4. You Break Platform Rules**
- Side trading violates platform terms
- You may be banned from the platform
- You lose access to all platform benefits
- No second chances

**5. You Harm the System**
- Side trading undermines the platform
- Reduces trust in the system
- Hurts other traders and farmers
- Makes the platform less valuable for everyone

### ✅ How the Platform Discourages Side Trading

**1. Payment Protection**
- Money is locked until delivery verified
- You get money back if delivery fails
- Admin verifies all deliveries
- Side trading has no protection

**2. Transaction Tracking**
- All transactions tracked with UTIDs
- Admin can see all activity
- Side trading can't be tracked
- You're accountable for all transactions

**3. Deadline Enforcement**
- Strict 6-hour delivery deadline
- Admin verifies all deliveries
- Side trading has no deadlines
- Platform ensures accountability

**4. Anonymity Protection**
- Farmers don't know your real identity
- You don't know farmer real identity
- Side trading requires sharing identities
- Platform protects your privacy

**5. Fair Pricing**
- You see farmer prices upfront
- No hidden negotiations
- Transparent pricing
- Side trading may involve unfair prices

**6. Spend Cap Protection**
- Platform enforces spend cap (UGX 1,000,000)
- Prevents overexposure
- Side trading has no limits
- You may overextend yourself

### ✅ Real Example: Why Side Trading Fails

**Scenario**: You find a farmer selling 100kg of maize at UGX 1,900/kg outside the platform (cheaper than platform price of UGX 2,000/kg). You agree to buy directly.

**What Happens**:
1. You agree to side trade
2. You pay farmer directly (no platform protection)
3. Farmer promises to deliver tomorrow
4. Tomorrow comes, farmer doesn't deliver
5. You call farmer, no answer
6. You've lost your money and have no produce

**With Platform**:
1. You pay through platform (protected)
2. Farmer must deliver within 6 hours
3. Admin verifies delivery
4. If farmer doesn't deliver, you get money back
5. You're protected

**Lesson**: Platform protection is worth more than a slightly lower price.
