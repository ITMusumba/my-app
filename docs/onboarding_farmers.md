## What This System Allows You to Do

### 1. List Your Produce

**You can create listings** for your produce (maize, beans, rice, etc.) in **10kg units**.

**Example**:
- You have 50kg of maize to sell
- You create a listing for 50kg at UGX 2,000 per kilo
- The system automatically splits it into 5 units of 10kg each
- Each unit can be purchased separately by traders

**Why 10kg units?**
- Makes it easier for traders to buy what they need
- Allows multiple traders to buy from your listing
- Gives you more flexibility

### 2. See Your Active Listings

**You can view**:
- All your listings (active, locked, completed)
- How many units are available
- How many units have been purchased
- Your listing history

### 3. Track Deliveries

**You can see**:
- When a trader pays for your produce (you get a payment confirmation)
- The exact deadline for delivery (6 hours after payment)
- A countdown showing how much time you have left
- Whether your delivery was verified by admin

### 4. Negotiate Prices

**You set your price** when creating a listing. Traders can see your price and decide whether to buy. Once a trader pays, the price is locked - no more negotiations.

## Strict Deadlines - This is Critical!

### ⚠️ 6-Hour Delivery Deadline

**When a trader pays for your produce, you have exactly 6 hours to deliver it.**

**Example Timeline**:
- **2:00 PM**: Trader pays for 10kg of maize
- **8:00 PM**: Your delivery deadline
- **You must deliver by 8:00 PM** or you will be marked as late

**Why 6 Hours?**
- Traders need to receive produce quickly to sell it
- Keeps the market moving
- Ensures produce stays fresh
- Protects traders who have already paid

**What Happens if You're Late?**
- Admin will review your delivery
- If you delivered late, admin marks it as "late"
- Your transaction may be reversed (trader gets money back)
- Your produce may be unlocked (available for other traders)
- You may lose the sale

**Important**: The deadline is **strict**. There are no extensions. Plan your delivery carefully.

## Admin Authority - How It Works

### Admin Makes Final Decisions

**Admins are the final decision-makers** in Farm2Market Uganda. They:

1. **Verify Deliveries**
   - Admin checks if you delivered on time
   - Admin confirms the produce quality
   - Admin marks delivery as "delivered" or "late"

2. **Handle Disputes**
   - If there's a problem, admin investigates
   - Admin makes the final decision
   - Admin's decision is final - no appeals

3. **Reverse Transactions**
   - If you don't deliver on time, admin can reverse the transaction
   - Trader gets their money back
   - Your produce becomes available again

4. **Monitor the System**
   - Admin watches all transactions
   - Admin ensures fairness
   - Admin protects all users

**Why Admin Authority?**
- Ensures fairness for everyone
- Prevents disputes from dragging on
- Protects traders who have already paid
- Keeps the system running smoothly

**What This Means for You**:
- Deliver on time to avoid admin intervention
- Be honest about your produce quality
- Communicate with admin if you have problems
- Admin decisions are final - respect them

## What Happens on Failure

### Scenario 1: You Don't Deliver on Time

**What Happens**:
1. Your delivery deadline passes (6 hours after payment)
2. Admin reviews your delivery status
3. Admin marks it as "late"
4. Admin reverses the transaction:
   - Trader gets their money back
   - Your produce is unlocked (available for other traders)
   - You lose the sale

**Impact on You**:
- ❌ You don't get paid
- ❌ Your produce is still available (but you lost the sale)
- ❌ Your reputation may be affected
- ❌ You may be restricted from future listings

**How to Avoid This**:
- ✅ Plan your delivery route in advance
- ✅ Have transport ready before listing
- ✅ Deliver early if possible
- ✅ Communicate with admin if you have problems

### Scenario 2: You Deliver Poor Quality Produce

**What Happens**:
1. Trader receives your produce
2. Trader reports quality issues to admin
3. Admin investigates
4. Admin may:
   - Reject the delivery
   - Reverse the transaction
   - Mark you as unreliable

**Impact on You**:
- ❌ You don't get paid
- ❌ Your produce may be returned
- ❌ Your reputation is damaged
- ❌ You may be restricted from future listings

**How to Avoid This**:
- ✅ Only list quality produce
- ✅ Be honest about produce condition
- ✅ Package produce properly
- ✅ Deliver fresh produce

### Scenario 3: You Create Too Many Listings

**What Happens**:
- System limits you to **10 listings per day**
- If you try to create more, you'll get an error
- You must wait until the next day

**Impact on You**:
- ⚠️ You can't create more listings that day
- ⚠️ You must plan your listings better

**How to Avoid This**:
- ✅ Plan your listings in advance
- ✅ Create listings strategically
- ✅ Don't spam the system

## Discouraging Side Trading - Why It Matters

### ❌ What is Side Trading?

**Side trading** means:
- Selling produce outside the platform
- Making deals with traders directly (not through the platform)
- Bypassing the platform's payment system
- Avoiding platform rules and deadlines

### ✅ Why You Should NOT Do Side Trading

**1. You Lose Protection**
- Platform protects you with payment guarantees
- Platform tracks all transactions
- Platform ensures fair prices
- Side trading has no protection

**2. You Risk Your Reputation**
- Platform tracks your delivery performance
- Good farmers get more opportunities
- Side trading can't be tracked
- You may lose platform access

**3. You Miss Out on Opportunities**
- Platform connects you with multiple traders
- More traders = more sales opportunities
- Side trading limits your reach
- You may get lower prices

**4. You Break Platform Rules**
- Side trading violates platform terms
- You may be banned from the platform
- You lose access to all platform benefits
- No second chances

**5. You Harm the System**
- Side trading undermines the platform
- Reduces trust in the system
- Hurts other farmers and traders
- Makes the platform less valuable for everyone

### ✅ How the Platform Discourages Side Trading

**1. Payment Guarantees**
- Traders pay before delivery
- You're guaranteed payment if you deliver on time
- No risk of non-payment
- Side trading has no guarantees

**2. Transaction Tracking**
- All transactions tracked with UTIDs
- Admin can see all activity
- Side trading can't be tracked
- You're accountable for all transactions

**3. Deadline Enforcement**
- Strict 6-hour delivery deadline
- Admin verifies all deliveries
- Side trading has no deadlines
- Platform ensures accountability

**4. Anonymity Protection**
- Traders don't know your real identity
- You don't know trader real identity
- Side trading requires sharing identities
- Platform protects your privacy

**5. Fair Pricing**
- You set your price
- Traders see your price
- No hidden negotiations
- Side trading may involve unfair prices

### ✅ Real Example: Why Side Trading Fails

**Scenario**: You list 50kg of maize on the platform at UGX 2,000/kg. A trader contacts you directly and offers UGX 2,100/kg if you sell outside the platform.

**What Happens**:
1. You agree to side trade
2. You remove your listing from the platform
3. Trader promises to pay UGX 2,100/kg
4. You deliver the produce
5. Trader doesn't pay (or pays less)
6. You have no protection
7. You lost the sale and the produce

**With Platform**:
1. You list 50kg at UGX 2,000/kg
2. Trader pays through platform (guaranteed)
3. You deliver within 6 hours
4. Admin verifies delivery
5. You get paid (guaranteed)
6. You're protected

**Lesson**: Platform protection is worth more than a slightly higher price.
