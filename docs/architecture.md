# System Architecture Overview

This repository is the single source of truth. All execution, validation, authorization, launch, and governance documents live under this repository.

## Execution Philosophy

- Nothing is assumed.
- Nothing is inferred.
- Artifacts must exist to be referenced.

## Lifecycle Structure

- Design Phase
- Execution Phase
- Validation Phase
- Launch Phase

## Governance Principles

- Authorization ≠ execution
- Planning ≠ activation
- Documentation ≠ reality
