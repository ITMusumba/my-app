## What This System Allows You to Do

### 1. View Available Inventory

**You can see** available produce in **100kg blocks** when the purchase window is open.

**Example**:
- Trader has 200kg of maize in storage
- You see 2 blocks of 100kg each
- You can purchase 1 block (100kg) or 2 blocks (200kg)
- You see produce type and quantity

**What You See**:
- ✅ Produce type (maize, beans, rice, etc.)
- ✅ Total kilos available
- ✅ Block size (100kg blocks)
- ✅ Trader alias (for reference only)

**What You DON'T See**:
- ❌ Prices (never shown to buyers)
- ❌ Trader real identity
- ❌ Storage fees
- ❌ Purchase history

**Why No Prices?**
- Prevents price manipulation
- Ensures fair trading
- Protects trader margins
- Maintains market stability

### 2. Check Purchase Window Status

**You can check** if the purchase window is currently open.

**Purchase Window**:
- Admin controls when window is open
- Window can be open or closed
- You can only purchase when window is open
- Window status is visible in your dashboard

**Why Purchase Windows?**
- Controls market timing
- Prevents overselling
- Ensures inventory availability
- Manages market flow

### 3. Purchase Produce

**You can purchase** 100kg blocks when the purchase window is open.

**Example**:
- Purchase window is open
- You see 2 blocks of 100kg maize available
- You purchase 1 block (100kg)
- Inventory is locked for you
- You have 48 hours to pick it up

**How It Works**:
1. Purchase window opens (admin-controlled)
2. You browse available inventory
3. You select a block to purchase
4. System locks inventory for you
5. You have 48 hours to pick up
6. You pick up produce from trader

**Important**: You cannot purchase when the window is closed. Wait for admin to open it.

### 4. View Your Orders

**You can see**:
- All your purchases (past and current)
- Pickup deadlines (48 hours after purchase)
- Order status (pending pickup, completed, cancelled)
- Produce type and quantity

**Example**:
- Purchase 1: 100kg maize, purchased Monday 2:00 PM, pickup deadline Wednesday 2:00 PM
- Purchase 2: 100kg beans, purchased Tuesday 10:00 AM, pickup deadline Thursday 10:00 AM

### 5. Track Pickup Deadlines

**You can see**:
- Exact pickup deadline (48 hours after purchase)
- Countdown showing how much time you have left
- Whether you're past the deadline
- Hours overdue (if past deadline)

**Example**:
- Purchased: Monday 2:00 PM
- Pickup deadline: Wednesday 2:00 PM
- Current time: Tuesday 10:00 AM
- Time remaining: 28 hours

## Strict Deadlines - This is Critical!

### ⚠️ 48-Hour Pickup Deadline

**When you purchase produce, you have exactly 48 hours to pick it up.**

**Example Timeline**:
- **Monday 2:00 PM**: You purchase 100kg of maize
- **Wednesday 2:00 PM**: Your pickup deadline
- **You must pick up by Wednesday 2:00 PM** or purchase may be cancelled

**Why 48 Hours?**
- Traders need to move inventory quickly
- Prevents inventory from sitting too long
- Ensures produce stays fresh
- Protects traders who have reserved inventory for you

**What Happens if You're Late?**:
- Admin will review your pickup
- Admin may cancel your purchase
- Inventory becomes available again
- You may lose the purchase
- Trader can sell to another buyer

**Important**: The deadline is **strict**. There are no extensions. Plan your pickup carefully.

## Discouraging Side Trading - Why It Matters

### ❌ What is Side Trading?

**Side trading** means:
- Buying produce outside the platform
- Making deals with traders directly (not through the platform)
- Bypassing the platform's purchase system
- Avoiding platform rules and deadlines

### ✅ Why You Should NOT Do Side Trading

**1. You Lose Protection**
- Platform protects you with purchase guarantees
- Platform tracks all transactions
- Platform ensures fair trading
- Side trading has no protection

**2. You Risk Your Money**
- Platform guarantees inventory availability
- Platform ensures pickup deadlines
- Side trading has no guarantees
- You may lose money if trader doesn't deliver

**3. You Miss Out on Opportunities**
- Platform connects you with multiple traders
- More traders = more purchase opportunities
- Side trading limits your reach
- You may miss better deals

**4. You Break Platform Rules**
- Side trading violates platform terms
- You may be banned from the platform
- You lose access to all platform benefits
- No second chances

**5. You Harm the System**
- Side trading undermines the platform
- Reduces trust in the system
- Hurts other buyers and traders
- Makes the platform less valuable for everyone

### ✅ How the Platform Discourages Side Trading

**1. Purchase Protection**
- Inventory is locked when you purchase
- Trader cannot sell to others
- You're guaranteed inventory availability
- Side trading has no protection

**2. Transaction Tracking**
- All transactions tracked with UTIDs
- Admin can see all activity
- Side trading can't be tracked
- You're accountable for all transactions

**3. Deadline Enforcement**
- Strict 48-hour pickup deadline
- Admin monitors all pickups
- Side trading has no deadlines
- Platform ensures accountability

**4. Anonymity Protection**
- Traders don't know your real identity
- You don't know trader real identity
- Side trading requires sharing identities
- Platform protects your privacy

**5. No Price Visibility**
- Prices not shown to buyers
- Prevents price manipulation
- Side trading may involve unfair prices
- Platform ensures fair trading

**6. Purchase Window Control**
- Admin controls when you can purchase
- Ensures inventory availability
- Side trading has no control
- Platform manages market flow

### ✅ Real Example: Why Side Trading Fails

**Scenario**: You find a trader selling 100kg of maize outside the platform. Trader offers a "better price" if you buy directly.

**What Happens**:
1. You agree to side trade
2. You pay trader directly (no platform protection)
3. Trader promises to deliver tomorrow
4. Tomorrow comes, trader doesn't deliver
5. You call trader, no answer
6. You've lost your money and have no produce

**With Platform**:
1. You purchase through platform (protected)
2. Inventory is locked for you
3. Trader must honor your purchase
4. You have 48 hours to pick up
5. You're protected

**Lesson**: Platform protection is worth more than a slightly better price.
