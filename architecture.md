**Production System Architecture**

**Status**: Production system preparing for full public go-live  
**Authority**: Single human (CEO / Engineering Lead / CTO)  
**Last Updated**: Current system state

**Context**: 
- VISION.md defines purpose and boundaries
- BUSINESS_LOGIC.md defines workflows, authority, and irreversible actions
- DOMAIN_MODEL.md defines entities, ownership, states, and transitions
- This document describes structure and boundaries only (no code, no workflows, no business logic)

## 1. High-Level System Overview

### Major Components

| Component | Responsibility | Trust Boundary |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Frontend (Next.js)** | User interface, client-side rendering, user input collection | Untrusted (client-side) |
| **Backend (Convex)** | Business logic, data storage, authorization, transaction processing | Trusted (server-side) |
| **Deployment Infrastructure** | Hosting, routing, environment configuration | External dependency |

### Component Responsibilities

**Frontend (Next.js App Router)**:
- Renders user interface based on user role
- Collects user input and sends to backend
- Displays data received from backend
- Handles client-side routing and navigation
- **Does NOT** enforce business rules or authorization
- **Does NOT** store sensitive data
- **Does NOT** make autonomous decisions

**Backend (Convex)**:
- Stores all entities (User, Listing, ListingUnit, WalletLedger, TraderInventory, BuyerPurchase, PurchaseWindow, StorageFeeDeduction, AdminAction, SystemSettings, Notification, RateLimitHit)
- Enforces business rules and authorization
- Validates all user actions server-side
- Generates UTIDs for all meaningful actions
- Processes atomic transactions (pay-to-lock, reversals)
- Enforces exposure limits and rate limits
- Logs admin actions and rate limit violations
- **Does NOT** trust client-side data
- **Does NOT** make autonomous decisions without human authorization

**Deployment Infrastructure**:
- **Vercel**: Hosts frontend, routes requests, manages environment variables
- **Convex**: Hosts backend, manages database, executes functions, provides real-time subscriptions
- **BLOCKED**: Backup and restore procedures are UNKNOWN (Convex managed, but operator access is UNKNOWN)

---

## 2. Component Breakdown

### Frontend Component

**Purpose**: Provide user interface for all user roles (farmer, trader, buyer, admin)

**Owned Entities**: None (frontend does not own entities, only displays them)

**Read Permissions**: 
- Reads all entities via Convex queries (subject to backend authorization)
- Cannot read entities directly (all reads go through backend)

**Write Permissions**: 
- Cannot write entities directly (all writes go through backend mutations)
- Sends user input to backend for processing

**Trust Boundary Classification**: **Untrusted**
- All user input must be validated server-side
- All authorization must be enforced server-side
- Frontend cannot bypass backend validation

### Backend Component (Convex)

**Purpose**: Enforce business logic, store data, process transactions, authorize actions

**Owned Entities**: All entities from DOMAIN_MODEL.md:
- User
- Listing
- ListingUnit
- WalletLedger
- TraderInventory
- BuyerPurchase
- PurchaseWindow
- StorageFeeDeduction
- AdminAction
- SystemSettings
- Notification
- RateLimitHit

**Read Permissions**: 
- Backend can read all entities (for authorization and business logic)
- Users can read entities only through authorized queries (enforced server-side)

**Write Permissions**: 
- Backend can write all entities (subject to authorization rules)
- Users can write entities only through authorized mutations (enforced server-side)
- Admin can write: ListingUnit (delivery status), TraderInventory (status), PurchaseWindow (open/close), SystemSettings (pilot mode), User (role, suspend/unsuspend)
- System can write: WalletLedger, ListingUnit (via listing creation), TraderInventory (via delivery), StorageFeeDeduction, Notification, RateLimitHit
- **BLOCKED**: StorageFeeDeduction automation write authority is UNKNOWN
- **BLOCKED**: Delivery verification write authority is UNKNOWN

**Trust Boundary Classification**: **Trusted**
- All business logic enforcement happens here
- All authorization enforcement happens here
- All transaction atomicity is guaranteed here

### Deployment Infrastructure Component

**Purpose**: Host and route requests, manage environment configuration

**Owned Entities**: None (infrastructure does not own domain entities)

**Read Permissions**: 
- Infrastructure can read environment variables
- Infrastructure cannot read domain entities

**Write Permissions**: 
- Infrastructure cannot write domain entities
- Infrastructure can manage deployment configuration

**Trust Boundary Classification**: **External Dependency**
- Infrastructure is outside system control
- Infrastructure failures affect system availability
- Infrastructure does not enforce business logic

## 3. Data Layer Architecture

### Where Data Lives

**All data lives in Convex database**:
- All entities from DOMAIN_MODEL.md are stored in Convex tables
- No data is stored in frontend (client-side storage is not used for domain entities)
- No data is stored in external systems (no third-party business integrations)

**Data Storage by Entity**:
| Entity | Storage Location | Access Method |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| User | Convex `users` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| Listing | Convex `listings` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| ListingUnit | Convex `listingUnits` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| WalletLedger | Convex `walletLedger` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| TraderInventory | Convex `traderInventory` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| BuyerPurchase | Convex `buyerPurchases` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| PurchaseWindow | Convex `purchaseWindows` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| StorageFeeDeduction | Convex `storageFeeDeductions` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| AdminAction | Convex `adminActions` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| SystemSettings | Convex `systemSettings` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| Notification | Convex `notifications` table | Convex queries/mutations |
| RateLimitHit | Convex `rateLimitHits` table | Convex queries/mutations |

### Immutability Guarantees

- **Listing**: State transitions (active → partially_locked → fully_locked → delivered/cancelled) are allowed.
- **ListingUnit**: State transitions (available → locked → delivered/cancelled) are allowed. Delivery status changes are logged.
- **TraderInventory**: State transitions (pending_delivery → in_storage → sold/expired) are allowed.
- **BuyerPurchase**: State transitions (pending_pickup → picked_up/expired) are allowed. **BLOCKED**: Purchase function NOT IMPLEMENTED.
- **PurchaseWindow**: State transitions (closed ↔ open) are allowed. Changes are logged.
- **SystemSettings**: Setting changes (pilotMode: true ↔ false) are allowed. Changes are logged.
- **Notification**: State transitions (unread → read) are allowed.

## 5. External Dependencies

### Infrastructure Providers

| Provider | Service | Failure Impact | Dependency Risk Ownership |
|----------|---------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Vercel** | Frontend hosting, routing, environment variables | System unavailable (users cannot access frontend) | System operator |
| **Convex** | Backend hosting, database, function execution, real-time subscriptions | System unavailable (users cannot access backend, data cannot be read/written) | System operator |

### Failure Impact Analysis

**Vercel Failure**:
- **Impact**: Frontend is unavailable. Users cannot access system.
- **Mitigation**: None (system depends on Vercel availability)
- **Recovery**: Vercel must restore service. System operator cannot restore independently.
- **Data Impact**: None (data is stored in Convex, not Vercel)

**Convex Failure**:
- **Impact**: Backend is unavailable. Users cannot access data or perform actions.
- **Mitigation**: None (system depends on Convex availability)
- **Recovery**: Convex must restore service. System operator cannot restore independently.
- **Data Impact**: **BLOCKED**: Data recovery procedures are UNKNOWN (backup/restore procedures are UNKNOWN)

### Dependency Risk Ownership

**System Operator Bears Risk For**:
- Vercel availability (frontend hosting)
- Convex availability (backend hosting, database)
- Convex data integrity (database integrity guarantees)
- **BLOCKED**: Convex backup/restore access (procedures are UNKNOWN)

**No Third-Party Business Integration Risks**:
- System does not integrate with external business services (banks, payment processors, SMS providers)
- No third-party business integration risks exist (by design)

## 6. Kill-Switch & Shutdown Design

### What Can Be Stopped

**Pilot Mode (Admin-Controlled Kill-Switch)**:
- **What It Stops**: All money-moving mutations (capital deposits, capital locks, profit withdrawals, unit locks)
- **Who Can Stop It**: Admin only
- **How It Works**: Admin sets `systemSettings.pilotMode = true`. Backend blocks all mutations that move money or inventory.
- **Reversibility**: Reversible (admin can set `pilotMode = false` to re-enable mutations)
- **What Continues**: Read-only operations continue (queries, data display)
- **What Must Never Continue**: Money-moving mutations must never continue when pilot mode is enabled

**Purchase Window (Admin-Controlled Kill-Switch)**:
- **What It Stops**: Buyer purchases (buyers cannot purchase inventory)
- **Who Can Stop It**: Admin only
- **How It Works**: Admin sets `purchaseWindows.isOpen = false`. Backend blocks buyer purchase mutations.
- **Reversibility**: Reversible (admin can set `isOpen = true` to re-enable purchases)
- **What Continues**: All other operations continue (farmers can list, traders can lock units, etc.)
- **What Must Never Continue**: Buyer purchases must never continue when purchase window is closed

**System Shutdown (System Operator-Controlled Kill-Switch)**:
- **What It Stops**: Entire system (frontend and backend become unavailable)
- **Who Can Stop It**: System operator (CEO / Engineering Lead / CTO) only
- **How It Works**: System operator shuts down Vercel deployment and/or Convex deployment
- **Reversibility**: Reversible (system operator can restart deployments)
- **What Continues**: Nothing (system is completely unavailable)
- **What Must Never Continue**: No operations must continue after system shutdown

### Who Can Stop It

| Kill-Switch | Authority | Enforcement | Auditability |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Pilot Mode | Admin | Backend mutation blocking | AdminAction log entry with UTID and reason |
| Purchase Window | Admin | Backend mutation blocking | AdminAction log entry with UTID and reason |
| System Shutdown | System Operator | Infrastructure shutdown | **BLOCKED**: Shutdown logging is UNKNOWN |

### What Continues Running After Shutdown

**After Pilot Mode Activation**:
- Read-only queries continue
- Data display continues
- User authentication continues
- **Must Never Continue**: Money-moving mutations

**After Purchase Window Closure**:
- All operations except buyer purchases continue
- Farmers can create listings
- Traders can lock units
- Admin can verify deliveries
- **Must Never Continue**: Buyer purchases

**After System Shutdown**:
- Nothing continues (system is completely unavailable)
- **Must Never Continue**: No operations

### What Must Never Continue Running

**After Pilot Mode Activation**:
- Capital deposits
- Capital locks
- Profit withdrawals
- Unit locks (pay-to-lock)
- **Enforcement**: Backend must block all mutations that move money or inventory

**After Purchase Window Closure**:
- Buyer purchases
- **Enforcement**: Backend must block buyer purchase mutations

**After System Shutdown**:
- All operations
- **Enforcement**: Infrastructure shutdown prevents all operations

**BLOCKED**: Shutdown logging and auditability for system shutdown are UNKNOWN.

## 7. Single-Human Authority Model

### Where Authority is Exercised

**System Operator Authority** (CEO / Engineering Lead / CTO):
- **Production Activation**: System operator can activate system for public go-live
- **System Shutdown**: System operator can shutdown system (emergency or planned)
- **BLOCKED**: Production activation is NOT verified (see `docs/architecture.md`)

**Admin Authority** (Single human with admin role):
- **Delivery Verification**: Admin can mark delivery as `delivered`, `late`, or `cancelled`
- **Transaction Reversal**: Admin can reverse transactions (unlock unit + unlock capital)
- **Purchase Window Control**: Admin can open or close purchase window
- **Pilot Mode Control**: Admin can enable or disable pilot mode
- **User Role Changes**: Admin can change user roles
- **BLOCKED**: Delivery verification function implementation status is UNKNOWN

### How Authority is Enforced

**Server-Side Enforcement**:
- All authority checks are enforced in Convex backend
- Frontend cannot bypass authority checks
- All mutations require server-side authorization

**Role-Based Enforcement**:
- Admin actions require `role === "admin"` (verified server-side)
- System operator actions require infrastructure access (outside application code)
- Users cannot change their own role
- Users cannot bypass exposure limits

**Pilot Mode Enforcement**:
- When `systemSettings.pilotMode === true`, backend blocks all money-moving mutations
- Enforcement is server-side (frontend cannot bypass)
- **BLOCKED**: Pilot mode enforcement implementation status is UNKNOWN (assumed to exist)

### How Authority is Audited

**Admin Actions**:
- All admin actions are logged in `adminActions` table
- Each log entry includes: adminId, actionType, utid, reason, targetUtid, timestamp
- Log entries are immutable (cannot be modified or deleted)
- **BLOCKED**: Delivery verification actions may not be logged if function is not implemented

**System Operator Actions**:
- **BLOCKED**: System operator actions (production activation, system shutdown) are not logged in system
- System operator actions are outside application code (infrastructure level)
- **BLOCKED**: Shutdown logging and auditability are UNKNOWN

**User Actions**:
- User actions are tracked via UTIDs (all meaningful actions generate UTIDs)
- UTIDs are immutable and cannot be modified
- UTIDs provide audit trail for all transactions

**BLOCKED**: Complete auditability for system operator actions is UNKNOWN.
