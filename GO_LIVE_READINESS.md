**Production System Go-Live Readiness Assessment**

**Status**: Production system preparing for full public go-live  
**Authority**: Single human (CEO / Engineering Lead / CTO)  
**Last Updated**: Current system state

**Context**: 
- VISION.md defines intended scope and blocked items
- INVARIANTS.md defines what must never be violated
- THREAT_MODEL.md defines material risks
- AUDIT_MODEL.md defines forensic guarantees
- OBSERVABILITY_MODEL.md defines real-time awareness
- architecture.md defines kill-switches and trust boundaries
- BUSINESS_LOGIC.md defines irreversible actions
- MODULARITY_GUIDE.md defines forbidden couplings

**Readiness Assessment**: Binary per capability (ALLOWED or BLOCKED). Partial readiness is not allowed.

## 1. Readiness Principles

### Core Principles

**1. Binary Readiness**
- Each capability is either ALLOWED or BLOCKED
- Partial readiness is not allowed
- If any prerequisite is unmet, capability is BLOCKED

**2. Invariant Compliance**
- If any invariant cannot be verified, capability is BLOCKED
- If any invariant violation cannot be detected, capability is BLOCKED
- If any invariant violation cannot be responded to, capability is BLOCKED

**3. Threat Mitigation**
- If any material threat cannot be mitigated, capability is BLOCKED
- If any material threat cannot be observed, capability is BLOCKED
- If any material threat cannot be responded to, capability is BLOCKED

**4. Audit Completeness**
- If any irreversible action is not auditable, capability is BLOCKED
- If any audit gap exists, capability is BLOCKED
- If any audit log can be modified or deleted, capability is BLOCKED

**5. Observability Completeness**
- If any critical metric cannot be measured, capability is BLOCKED
- If any critical alert cannot be triggered, capability is BLOCKED
- If any critical rollback trigger cannot be detected, capability is BLOCKED

**6. No Softening Language**
- BLOCKED means BLOCKED (not "partially ready" or "mostly ready")
- ALLOWED means fully ready (not "ready with caveats")
- No future work justifies current readiness

- Trader Unit Lock (Pay-to-Lock)
- Transaction Reversal (Admin)
- Profit Withdrawal from Ledger
- Purchase Window Control (Admin)
- Pilot Mode Control (Admin)
- User Role Changes (Admin)
- User Account Suspension/Deletion (Admin)

**Capabilities BLOCKED**: 10
- Production Authentication
- Buyer Purchase Function
- Delivery Verification Function
- Storage Fee Automation
- Pilot Mode Enforcement
- Legal Compliance
- Terms of Service and User Agreements
- Backup and Restore Procedures
- Health Check Endpoints
- Profit Withdrawal External Transfer

**Critical BLOCKED Capabilities** (Must be resolved before go-live):
1. Production Authentication (BLOCKED 1)
2. Legal Compliance (BLOCKED 6)
3. Terms of Service and User Agreements (BLOCKED 7)
4. Backup and Restore Procedures (BLOCKED 8)
5. Pilot Mode Enforcement (BLOCKED 5)

**Non-Critical BLOCKED Capabilities** (Can go live without, but limit functionality):
1. Buyer Purchase Function (BLOCKED 2) - Buyers cannot purchase
2. Delivery Verification Function (BLOCKED 3) - Transaction reversals cannot be performed
3. Storage Fee Automation (BLOCKED 4) - Storage fees may not be deducted automatically
4. Health Check Endpoints (BLOCKED 9) - System availability cannot be monitored
5. Profit Withdrawal External Transfer (BLOCKED 10) - Traders cannot withdraw to bank accounts

### Final Declaration

**GO-LIVE STATUS**: **BLOCKED**

**Reason**: Critical capabilities are BLOCKED. System cannot go live until critical BLOCKED capabilities are resolved.

**Required Before Go-Live**:
1. ✅ **MUST**: Production Authentication implemented and verified
2. ✅ **MUST**: Legal Compliance verified (legal review completed)
3. ✅ **MUST**: Terms of Service and User Agreements completed
4. ✅ **MUST**: Backup and Restore Procedures verified
5. ✅ **MUST**: Pilot Mode Enforcement verified and implemented

**Optional Before Go-Live** (can go live without, but limit functionality):
1. Buyer Purchase Function implemented (buyers cannot purchase without this)
2. Delivery Verification Function verified and implemented (transaction reversals cannot be performed without this)
3. Storage Fee Automation verified and implemented (storage fees may not be deducted automatically without this)
4. Health Check Endpoints implemented (system availability cannot be monitored without this)
5. Profit Withdrawal External Transfer implemented (traders cannot withdraw to bank accounts without this)

**Global Risks Acknowledged**:
- Infrastructure dependency failure (high risk, no mitigation)
- Admin abuse (medium risk, logged but no automated oversight)
- System operator delayed response (medium risk, not monitored)
- Legal compliance risk (high risk, BLOCKED)
- Data loss risk (high risk, BLOCKED)

**Authority Confirmation**:
- System operator has kill-switch and shutdown authority
- Admin has pilot mode and purchase window authority
- Kill-switch enforcement is BLOCKED (may not be effective)

**Operator Readiness**:
- Operator has partial readiness (some capabilities are BLOCKED)
- Operator cannot verify legal compliance (BLOCKED)
- Operator cannot verify user consent (BLOCKED)
- Operator cannot restore data (BLOCKED)

## Final Check

### Every Capability Is Either ALLOWED or BLOCKED

**Verified**: All 20 capabilities are explicitly marked as ALLOWED or BLOCKED:
- 11 capabilities are ALLOWED
- 10 capabilities are BLOCKED
- No capabilities are marked as "partially ready" or "mostly ready"

### No BLOCKED Capability Is Implicitly Usable

**Verified**: All BLOCKED capabilities are explicitly marked as BLOCKED:
- BLOCKED capabilities cannot be used
- BLOCKED capabilities have explicit reasons
- BLOCKED capabilities have preconditions to unblock

### All Irreversible Actions Are Covered by Audit and Observability

**Verified**: All irreversible actions from BUSINESS_LOGIC.md are covered:
- UTID Generation: Auditable and observable
- Capital Deposit: Auditable and observable
- Unit Lock: Auditable and observable
- Profit Withdrawal: Auditable and observable
- Transaction Reversal: Auditable and observable (but depends on delivery verification - BLOCKED)
- Alias Generation: Auditable and observable
- Ledger Entry Creation: Auditable and observable
- Storage Fee Deduction: BLOCKED (automation status UNKNOWN)
- Listing Unit Splitting: Auditable and observable
- User Account Creation: Auditable and observable

### Operator Authority Is Preserved

**Verified**: Operator authority is preserved:
- System operator has kill-switch and shutdown authority
- System operator has rollback authority
- System operator has investigation and correction authority
- Some operator capabilities are BLOCKED (legal compliance, backup/restore)

### Residual Risk Is Explicitly Acknowledged

**Verified**: All residual risks are explicitly acknowledged:
- Risk 1: Infrastructure Dependency Failure (high risk)
- Risk 2: Admin Abuse (medium risk)
- Risk 3: System Operator Delayed Response (medium risk)
- Risk 4: Legal Compliance Risk (high risk, BLOCKED)
- Risk 5: Data Loss Risk (high risk, BLOCKED)

### The Declaration Can Be Used as a Real Go/No-Go Decision Artifact

**Verified**: The declaration is explicit and actionable:
- Go-Live Status: BLOCKED
- Reason: Critical capabilities are BLOCKED
- Required Before Go-Live: 5 critical capabilities must be resolved
- Optional Before Go-Live: 5 non-critical capabilities can be deferred
- Global Risks: Acknowledged
- Authority Confirmation: Partial (some capabilities are BLOCKED)
- Operator Readiness: Partial (some capabilities are BLOCKED)

---

**FINAL DECLARATION**: **NO-GO**

**System cannot go live until critical BLOCKED capabilities are resolved.**
