# BLOCKED 7 — Phase 2: Terms of Service & User Agreements — Uganda-Specific Clause Scaffolding

**BLOCKED 7: Terms of Service and User Agreements**  
**Execution Plan**: CRITICAL_CAPABILITY_EXECUTION_PLAN.md  
**Legal Framework**: Laws of the Republic of Uganda  
**Status**: Phase 2 — Drafting Framework (No Final Text)  
**Date**: 10 JAN-2026

**Purpose**: This document defines the contractual structure and clause architecture for Platform Terms of Service and Role-Specific User Agreements. This phase does not finalize clause language, does not implement acceptance flows, and does not create binding contracts yet. It establishes what clauses will exist, their legal intent, and Ugandan statutory alignment.

**No Implementation**: This document does not implement any code, features, or changes. Only clause scaffolding, legal intent definition, and drafting framework specification.

---

## 1. Purpose of Phase 2

Phase 2 defines the contractual structure and clause architecture for:

* Platform Terms of Service
* Role-specific User Agreements

**This phase**:
- Does not finalize clause language
- Does not implement acceptance flows
- Does not create binding contracts yet

**It establishes**:
- What clauses will exist
- Their legal intent
- Ugandan statutory alignment
- Drafting boundaries

**Phase 2 Objectives**:
1. Define contract architecture (document hierarchy)
2. Establish clause scaffolding for Platform Terms of Service
3. Establish clause scaffolding for Role-Specific User Agreements
4. Align with BLOCKED 6 legal characterization
5. Align with Ugandan statutory law
6. Define drafting boundaries and exclusions

---

## 2. Contract Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Document Hierarchy

**Master Platform Terms of Service**
- Applies to all users
- Governs access, records, data, and platform operation
- Defines platform nature, liability boundaries, and general terms

**Role-Specific User Agreements**
- **Farmer Agreement** — Agricultural producers
- **Trader Agreement** — Intermediaries
- **Buyer Agreement** — End consumers
- **Administrator Agreement** — System administrators

**Hierarchy Rule**:
- Role-specific agreements supplement the Terms of Service
- In case of conflict, role agreement prevails for that role only
- Both documents must be accepted by users

**Legal Basis**: Contract law allows layered agreements (master terms + role-specific terms). This structure provides clarity and role-specific risk allocation.
