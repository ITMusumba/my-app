# Dormant Code

This directory contains code that is not currently in use but is preserved for reference.

## Contents

### `supabase/`
- **Status**: Dormant
- **Reason**: Project uses Convex as the backend provider, not Supabase
- **Note**: All Supabase-related code has been moved here. The active backend is Convex (see `convex/` directory)

## Reactivation

If you need to reactivate any dormant code:
1. Review the current architecture in `docs/architecture.md`
2. Ensure compatibility with the current tech stack (Next.js + Convex)
3. Update any dependencies and configurations
4. Test thoroughly before integration
